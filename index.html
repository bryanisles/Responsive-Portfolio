				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<p>
					As indicated by the title of this webpage my name is Bryan Isles.  I was born in Chicago Illinois on the 21st of October 1985.  I was raised in the Northside of Chicago and lived with my grandmother, parents, and siblings until my college years.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I was raised as a Catholic and was sent to both a Catholic elementary grade school and high school.  One of the many things that shaped my life was the constant reminder of morality predicated on the religious environments that surrounded me throughout my life.  Though this was the case, I found myself struggling to accept stories about a transcendent being who we called God.  It was not until I received my Bachelor degree when I started to delve back into religion in order to restructure in my life, though I digress.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I am a person who follows a maxim that a person should never accept anything and always question everything.  This mentaility allowed me to approach the world in a cautious way, not allowing immediate acceptance until the scope of a subject is fully understood.  Rather than to shunt a subject in mere ignorance, I asked questions such as "why do people enjoy certain activities or why does such an activity exist?" This was the mechanism that set my mind in motion. I continued this trajectory of questioning everything, but not only through mental notes, but through physical interactions with such activities. It was not until I had fully immersed myself into these environments that I began to judge whether I would continue a certain path or diverge from it. This is what lead me in a direction of trying new and different things that I would have never considered.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Some of my previous pastimes were playing the piano, doing martial arts, break-dancing, etc.  I now find that my current pastime is spending time with my wife and daughter, which becomes more and more difficult mainly due to my day-job and the commute.  I hope to find something in regards to work that is closer to home and keeps me mentally engaged.
